Guild Wars 2 Guild Info
=======================

This set of scripts is for use with Guild Wars 2.

It was designed to be used to track membership of a guild, display
information about the contents of the guild stash (bank) and show
guild hall upgrade availability.

Guild Wars 2 API Key
--------------------

You will first need to create an API key for your account at
https://account.arena.net/applications and give it the 'account'
and 'guilds' permissions.

Copy Config.default.php to Config.php and update the API_KEY value.

Run the script 'list_guilds.php' to show the guild ids for your account. 

Update the GUILD_ID value in Config.php with the id of the guild you wish to access.

Database connection
-------------------

You'll also need to configure the database connection in Config.php with the
hostname (often localhost), database name, username and password. GW2DB assumes
the database type is MySQL. If it isn't, the PDO connection string will need to
be altered.

Import tables.sql into the new database. Note that it will remove the tables before
creating them so any previous data would be lost.

$ mysql databasename < tables.sql

Generation of the items table data
----------------------------------

Run update-items.php and it should fetch just over 53,000 items and
store them in the database table 'items'

Once finished, you should be able to check it using a page like gw2item.php?id=12345
and see the information for "Strawberry Cookie"
